Week4 Project Assignment for Collecting and Cleaning Data

There is only one script in this directory, it is **run_analysis.R**, and is
fully documented within.  It performs the following functions:
1. Collect testing and training data from the specified sources
2. Combine testing and training data to create a single merged dataset
3. Reduce the dataset to observations that provide mean() or std() results
4. Add Activity Names, in addition to the original Activity ID, to make the data clearer
5. Group the data by Subject ID and Activity ID in order to generate mean()'s of all
6. Produce a new tidy data set containing these means in a clear and readable form

In this directory is the new tidy data set containing the means of all
the dat grouped by subject and activity.  It is in **new_tidy_data_means.txt**.

In this directory is also the codebook for this project, in **CodeBook.md**.
